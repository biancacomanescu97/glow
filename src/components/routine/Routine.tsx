            My skincare routine is quite intuitive. What I usually keep in
            place is vitamin C and suncreen in the morning, niacinamide at
            night. The other products are added by "scanning my face" and
            see what does it need. If it's a bit congested, I use products
            with exfoliation properties, like BHA. If it's dehydrated, I use
            hygrating products. If I use Hylauronic Acid and I'm not in a
            humid environment, I use some face mist before and/or after I
            apply the HA. You get the gist.

            When applying products: from the lightest consistency to the

            Using vitamin C and SPF in the morning: combining a vitamin C
            serum and broad-spectrum sunscreens (protects against UVA rays
            as well) have been shown to be more effective at neutralizing
            free radical damage from sun exposure than just using sunscreen
            alone.

            Using a double-cleanse method when I've worn make-up: an
            oil-based cleanser to easily melt away the make-up and other
            impurities - I'm just using my cleaned hands with this one,
            followed by a water-based cleanser - used with the Foreo. I feel
            like I'm getting a more thorough clean this way.

            Using ingredients with anti-ageing properties (peptides,

            Using the Foreo LUNAâ„¢ 3 and facial massages helped me with
            lymphatic drainage, which resulted in a nice lift. Plus, when
            you are using facial massages, the products are more efficient
            as you are working them into your skin. I usually do a few after
            each step of my routine.

            I always try to finish the products bought. If I see they are
            not working for my face, I use them on my body or gift them to
            someone else if I really don't like them (it's usually because
            of the consistency or I got gifted sample products that are not
            for my skin type).

            I don't like using any type of cotton pads. I feel like they're
            dragging my skin and it feels quite harsh. Also, they are
            soaking up a lot of the product.
